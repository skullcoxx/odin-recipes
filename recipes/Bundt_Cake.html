    <p>This glazed Baileys Irish cream cake is great tasting and excellent for any occasion</p>
    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray with flour</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup Irish cream liqueur</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan with cooking spray. 
            Sprinkle chopped nuts evenly over the bottom of the pan</li>
        <li>Combine cake mix and pudding mix in a large bowl. Beat in eggs, Irish cream liqueur, oil, and water 
            with an electric mixer on high speed for 5 minutes. Pour batter over nuts in the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, 
            about 1 hour. Let cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While cake is cooling, make glaze: Combine sugar, butter, and water in a small saucepan. 
            Bring to a boil and continue boiling for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir 
            in Irish cream</li>
        <li>Invert cake onto a serving dish. Prick the top and sides of cake with a toothpick. Spoon glaze over 
            the top and brush onto the sides. Allow cake to absorb glaze, then repeat until glaze is used up.</li>
    </ol>
