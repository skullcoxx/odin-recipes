    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Irish shepherd's pie is a lovely alternative to the much more common corned beef and cabbage you may have 
        been planning for St. Patrick's Day dinner</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 pounds lean ground lamb</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Place olive oil and butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in ground lamb and onion; 
            cook and stir until meat is brown and crumbly, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour until incorporated. Mix in garlic, ketchup, rosemary, paprika, cinnamon, salt, 
            and pepper; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in water, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven. Reduce heat to 
            medium-low and bring mixture to a simmer; cook and stir until thick, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove lamb mixture from heat, then stir in peas and carrots until combined</li>
