    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it has a deep, complex, rich flavor. 
        The matinees of dark beer really does amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green 
        onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint Patrick's Day or any time of the year
